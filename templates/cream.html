        <p>
            The Creative Arts Ministry, fondly referred to as CREAM, is the heartbeat of creative expression in the Christian Union.
            It revolves around drama, plays, spoken word, and other forms of artistic presentation that communicate the gospel in dynamic and impactful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through engaging performances and thought-provoking scripts, CREAM uses the arts to illustrate the power of God’s Word and to address contemporary issues
            affecting the Christian community and society at large.
