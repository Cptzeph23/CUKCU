        <p>
            The Discipleship Ministry exists to nurture, mentor, and equip members of the Christian Union to grow in their faith and walk with Christ. 
            Through intentional mentorship, Bible-based teaching, and life application, this ministry fosters spiritual maturity and prepares members 
            to disciple others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rooted in the Great Commission, the ministry emphasizes the importance of making disciples who, in turn, disciple others, ensuring 
            the continuous growth of the Christian Union spiritually and numerically.
